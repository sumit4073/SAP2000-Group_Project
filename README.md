Model and Analysis of RC frame building in SAP 2000 in a group of 3 students
---
Modelling and analysis an 8-storeyed moment-resistant reinforced concrete building frame (without any brick masonry wall) on rocky ground condition.

**The building has the following details:**

Floor-to-floor height : 3.2 m; <br />
Height of foundation storey : 3.2 m; <br />
Thickness of floor slabs and roof slab : 115 mm; <br />
Size of beam : 250 mm x 400 mm; <br />
Size of column : 400 mm x 400 mm; <br />
Grade of concrete : M30; <br />
Live load on roof : 1.5 kPa; <br />
Live load on floor : 3 kPa; <br />
Load combinations : (a) 1.5 DL + 1.5 LL, (b) 1.2 DL + 1.2 LL + 1.2 HL (DL, LL and HL are the dead load, live load and the horizontal load) <br />
We had to model the entire building in SAP2000 by 
(i) considering beams and columns as frame members and 
(ii) considering only the load distribution from slabs (do not model the slabs, assign rigid diaphragm constraint for the in-plane stiffness of the slabs).
